# Project Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Ratified:** 2025-10-21  
**Last Amended:** 2025-10-21  
**Project:** EKOI Corp

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the foundational principles and governance framework for the EKOI Corp project. These principles are non-negotiable standards that guide all development decisions, feature implementations, and technical choices. Adherence to these principles ensures consistency, quality, and maintainability across the entire codebase.

## Core Principles

### Principle 1: Code Quality Excellence

All code MUST meet professional standards of quality, maintainability, and clarity.

**Requirements:**
- Code MUST follow established language-specific style guides and conventions
- All functions and modules MUST have clear, single responsibilities
- Code MUST be self-documenting with meaningful variable and function names
- Complex logic MUST include explanatory comments
- Code MUST pass linting and static analysis without warnings
- Technical debt MUST be documented and tracked when unavoidable
- Code reviews are MANDATORY before merging to main branches

**Rationale:** High-quality code reduces maintenance costs, minimizes bugs, facilitates onboarding, and ensures long-term project sustainability.

### Principle 2: User Experience Consistency

User interactions and workflows MUST be consistent across all features and pages.

**Requirements:**
- User workflows MUST follow predictable patterns throughout the application
- Form interactions MUST behave consistently (validation, submission, error handling)
- Navigation patterns MUST remain uniform across all sections
- Feedback mechanisms (success/error messages, loading states) MUST use standardized patterns
- User expectations set in one area MUST be honored in all similar contexts
- Terminology and language MUST be consistent across all user-facing text

**Rationale:** Consistent user experience reduces cognitive load, improves learnability, and increases user satisfaction and productivity.

### Principle 3: UI Design Consistency

Visual design elements MUST maintain consistency across the entire application.

**Requirements:**
- Design system components MUST be used exclusively (no one-off custom components without justification)
- Color palette MUST adhere to defined brand guidelines
- Typography MUST follow established hierarchy and scale
- Spacing and layout MUST use standardized grid and spacing units
- Icons MUST come from a single, approved icon library
- Animation and transitions MUST follow defined timing and easing standards
- Component variants MUST be documented in the design system

**Rationale:** Visual consistency reinforces brand identity, creates professional appearance, and reduces design and development overhead.

### Principle 4: Responsive Design

All interfaces MUST function flawlessly across all device sizes and orientations.

**Requirements:**
- Layouts MUST adapt gracefully from mobile (320px) to ultra-wide (2560px+) screens
- Touch targets MUST be minimum 44×44px on mobile devices
- Content MUST be readable without horizontal scrolling on any viewport
- Interactive elements MUST be accessible on touch and pointer devices
- Performance MUST remain acceptable on mobile networks and devices
- Testing MUST include real device validation, not just browser simulation
- Breakpoints MUST be defined and documented in the design system

**Rationale:** Mobile and tablet usage continues to grow; responsive design ensures accessibility and usability for all users regardless of their device.

### Principle 5: Clear & Intuitive Interface

User interfaces MUST be immediately understandable with minimal learning curve.

**Requirements:**
- Primary actions MUST be visually prominent and clearly labeled
- Navigation structure MUST be logical and discoverable
- Error messages MUST be specific, helpful, and actionable
- Empty states MUST guide users on next steps
- Complex operations MUST provide progressive disclosure
- Help text and tooltips MUST be available for non-obvious features
- Microcopy MUST be clear, concise, and jargon-free
- Visual hierarchy MUST guide users naturally through content

**Rationale:** Clear interfaces reduce support costs, increase user confidence, minimize errors, and improve overall satisfaction and adoption.

### Principle 6: SEO Optimization

All public-facing pages MUST be optimized for search engine discovery and ranking.

**Requirements:**
- Every page MUST have unique, descriptive title tags (50-60 characters)
- Meta descriptions MUST be compelling and relevant (150-160 characters)
- Semantic HTML MUST be used correctly (headings hierarchy, landmarks, lists)
- Images MUST include descriptive alt text
- URLs MUST be human-readable and keyword-relevant
- Structured data (Schema.org) MUST be implemented where applicable
- Core Web Vitals MUST meet Google's "Good" thresholds
- Pages MUST be mobile-friendly per Google's Mobile-Friendly Test
- XML sitemap MUST be maintained and submitted
- Canonical URLs MUST be properly specified to avoid duplicate content

**Rationale:** Organic search drives sustainable traffic; proper SEO ensures visibility, discoverability, and competitive advantage in search rankings.

### Principle 7: Performance Excellence

Applications MUST deliver fast, responsive experiences across all network conditions.

**Requirements:**
- Initial page load MUST achieve Lighthouse Performance score ≥90
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) MUST be ≤1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) MUST be ≤2.5s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) MUST be ≤3.8s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) MUST be ≤0.1
- Bundle sizes MUST be monitored and justified
- Images MUST be optimized (WebP/AVIF, appropriate dimensions, lazy loading)
- Third-party scripts MUST be loaded asynchronously or deferred
- API responses MUST complete within 500ms for p95
- Database queries MUST be optimized and monitored for N+1 problems
- Performance regression tests MUST be part of CI/CD pipeline

**Rationale:** Performance directly impacts user satisfaction, conversion rates, SEO rankings, and business outcomes. Users expect instant responses.

## Governance

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal:** Any team member may propose an amendment by creating a documented proposal
2. **Review:** Proposal must be reviewed by technical leads and stakeholders
3. **Discussion:** Open discussion period minimum 3 business days
4. **Decision:** Requires consensus from technical leadership
5. **Implementation:** Amendment becomes effective upon version update and team notification

### Versioning Policy

Constitution versions follow Semantic Versioning:
- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward-incompatible changes, principle removals, or fundamental redefinitions
- **MINOR (x.Y.0):** New principles added or existing principles materially expanded
- **PATCH (x.y.Z):** Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance & Review

- All pull requests MUST reference applicable constitutional principles in review
- Quarterly reviews MUST assess adherence and identify improvement areas
- Violations MUST be documented with remediation plans
- Constitution MUST be reviewed annually for relevance and completeness

## Interpretation

When principles appear to conflict, the following priority applies:
1. User safety and data security (implied foundational principle)
2. User experience and interface clarity (Principles 2, 3, 4, 5)
3. Technical quality and performance (Principles 1, 7)
4. Discoverability and reach (Principle 6)

In all cases, team leads should be consulted for interpretation guidance.
