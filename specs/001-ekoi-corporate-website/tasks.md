## Task Execution Notes

### File Path Conventions

- Components: `src/components/{category}/{ComponentName}.tsx`
- Pages: `src/app/[locale]/{route}/page.tsx`
- Data: `src/data/{entity}.ts`
- Types: `src/types/index.ts`
- Utilities: `src/lib/{utility}.ts`
- Translations: `src/messages/{locale}.json`

### Dependency Rules

1. **Sequential Tasks:** Tasks without `[P]` must complete before the next task
2. **Parallel Tasks:** Tasks with `[P]` can run simultaneously with other `[P]` tasks
3. **Phase Dependencies:** New phase cannot start until previous blocking phase completes
4. **File Dependencies:** Tasks modifying the same file must run sequentially
5. **Test Dependencies:** Integration tests run after implementation

### Quality Standards

All tasks must meet:
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode (no errors)
- ✅ ESLint passes with no warnings
- ✅ Prettier formatting applied
- ✅ Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- ✅ Accessible (WCAG AA)
- ✅ Content in both English and Japanese
- ✅ Optimized images
