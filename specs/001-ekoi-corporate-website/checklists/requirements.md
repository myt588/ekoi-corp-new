# Specification Quality Checklist: EKOI Corporate Website

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids implementation details and focuses on what needs to be built and why, not how. All sections are complete and business-focused.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Resolution Summary**:
- All 3 clarifications resolved:
  1. ✅ Wireframe approach: Hybrid with standard B2B patterns and Tailwind CSS
  2. ✅ Target launch date: ASAP (aggressive 12-16 week timeline)
  3. ✅ Content management: Code-based (no CMS, JSON/YAML files)

**Notes**: All requirements include clear acceptance criteria. Success criteria are measurable and user-focused. Edge cases well documented. Scope is clear with future considerations separated out.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Each user story has specific, testable acceptance criteria. Success criteria are outcome-focused (visitor task completion rates, engagement metrics, performance targets).

## Clarifications Resolution

All clarifications have been resolved:

### 1. Wireframe Creation Approach ✅
**Location**: Design Specifications > Wireframes section  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Decision**: Hybrid approach using standard B2B patterns with Tailwind CSS for styling. Custom design focus on key pages (homepage, products), standard patterns for secondary pages.

### 2. Target Launch Date ✅
**Location**: Timeline section  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Decision**: ASAP with aggressive timeline targeting 12-16 weeks through parallelized workstreams and focused scope execution.

### 3. Content Management System Selection ✅
**Location**: Multiple sections updated  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Decision**: Code-based content management using JSON/YAML files for structured data, Markdown for articles. No CMS required. Content updates via Git workflow.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, comprehensive, and meets all quality standards. All clarification items have been resolved and incorporated into the specification. Technical approach (Tailwind CSS, code-based content) and timeline expectations (aggressive ASAP launch) are clearly documented.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to planning phase (`/speckit.plan`) to create detailed implementation plan.
