# Feature Specification: EKOI Corporate Website

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** EKOI Team

## Executive Summary

The EKOI corporate website will serve as the primary digital presence for EKOI, an AI server and infrastructure solutions provider. The website will showcase our GPU-powered server products (A100, H100, H200), cloud service partnerships, and company value proposition. With internationalization support for English and Japanese markets, the site will enable potential clients to explore our offerings, understand our competitive advantages, stay informed through news updates, and connect with our team through a secure contact form.

## Problem Statement

### Current State

EKOI currently lacks a professional digital presence to showcase its AI infrastructure solutions and GPU server offerings. Potential clients cannot easily discover our products, understand our partnerships with cloud service providers and hardware manufacturers, or evaluate how EKOI compares to competitors like CoreWeave. There is no central platform for sharing company news, displaying partner/client relationships, or facilitating business inquiries.

### Desired State

A fully functional, multilingual corporate website that serves as EKOI's primary marketing and lead generation platform. Visitors can seamlessly browse our GPU server catalog, explore cloud solution partnerships, understand our competitive advantages, read company news, view our ecosystem of partners and clients, and submit business inquiries through a secure contact form. The site adapts flawlessly across devices and supports both English and Japanese-speaking audiences with easy language switching.

### Success Criteria

1. Visitors can discover and evaluate all EKOI server products within 2 minutes of landing on the site
2. Language switching completes in under 500ms with full content translation
3. 80% of contact form submissions are qualified business inquiries (successful bot prevention)
4. Average time on site increases by 40% compared to industry benchmarks for B2B tech companies
5. Product detail pages receive at least 3 minutes average engagement time
6. Site loads in under 3 seconds on 3G networks globally
7. 90% of visitors can successfully complete their primary task (find product info, read news, submit contact form) without assistance

| Development - Phase 1 | 3-4 weeks | Homepage, navigation, i18n framework, responsive layouts, design system implementation |
| Development - Phase 2 | 3-4 weeks | Product catalog (list & detail pages), cloud solutions pages, news section |
| Development - Phase 3 | 2-3 weeks | Contact form with bot prevention, partners section, clients section, footer |
| Testing & QA | 2 weeks | Cross-browser testing, device testing, accessibility audit, performance optimization, security review |

## Risks & Open Questions

### Risks

1. **Content translation quality and cultural appropriateness**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: High
   - Mitigation: Engage native Japanese speaker for translation review and cultural adaptation, avoid machine translation for critical content

2. **Performance impact of i18n implementation**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient translation loading strategy, lazy load non-critical translations, cache translated content aggressively

3. **Bot spam overwhelming contact form**
   - Likelihood: High
   - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Implement multiple anti-bot measures (honeypot + reCAPTCHA v3 invisible), rate limiting, email validation, admin moderation queue

4. **Content maintenance burden for dual language**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Content will be managed directly in code. Translation files will use JSON/YAML format for easy updates. Establish clear code-based content update procedures with version control.

5. **Delayed content creation affecting timeline**
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Impact: High
   - Mitigation: Develop with placeholder content, establish content deadlines early, create templates for consistent formatting

6. **SEO competition with established players (CoreWeave, etc.)**
   - Likelihood: High
   - Impact: Medium
   - Mitigation: Focus on long-tail keywords, create detailed technical content, optimize for local Japanese market, implement comprehensive technical SEO

### Open Questions

1. Should the product catalog support filtering by additional criteria (price range, performance tier, availability)?

2. Do we need user accounts/authentication for any features (saved inquiries, quote management)?
